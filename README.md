This repository demonstrates an advanced video preprocessing technique using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model combined with BYTETracker for object tracking. The primary functionality includes detecting and tracking objects in a video stream and darkening all other pixels except for those within the bounding boxes of the detected objects. This preprocessing technique is especially useful in privacy-sensitive environments or for highlighting specific objects in a video analysis task.
